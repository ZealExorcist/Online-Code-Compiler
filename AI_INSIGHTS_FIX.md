# AI Insights Gemini API Key Fix

## Issue
The Gemini API key was not being properly saved and retrieved from the Account settings section. Users could enter the API key, but it wouldn't persist or be available in the OutputPanel for AI Insights functionality.

## Root Cause
The backend `UserSettings` class was missing the `geminiApiKey` and `enableErrorHighlighting` fields that the frontend was trying to save and retrieve.

## Solution
Added the missing fields to the backend `User.UserSettings` class:

### Backend Changes (User.java)
```java
// AI Settings
private boolean enableErrorHighlighting = true;
private String geminiApiKey = "";

// Added corresponding getters and setters
public boolean isEnableErrorHighlighting() { return enableErrorHighlighting; }
public void setEnableErrorHighlighting(boolean enableErrorHighlighting) { this.enableErrorHighlighting = enableErrorHighlighting; }

public String getGeminiApiKey() { return geminiApiKey; }
public void setGeminiApiKey(String geminiApiKey) { this.geminiApiKey = geminiApiKey; }
```

### Frontend Changes
- Removed debug logging from `CompilerInterface.vue` and `OutputPanel.vue` that was added during troubleshooting
- No functional changes needed on frontend - it was already correctly designed to handle the settings

## Testing
- Backend compiles successfully
- All backend tests pass
- Frontend type checking passes
- Settings flow works: Account → CompilerInterface → OutputPanel

## Result
✅ Gemini API keys entered in Account settings now properly:
- Save to the backend database
- Persist between sessions
- Propagate to the OutputPanel for AI Insights functionality
- Enable/disable the "Analyze Code" button appropriately

The AI Insights feature should now work correctly when users provide their Gemini API key.
